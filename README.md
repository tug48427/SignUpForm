# SignUpForm
The Sign Up Form asks a user to input a username, email, password and a confirm password. 
If any of the fields are left blank it will send a Toast message to the user that the specified field is blank.
It will also compare the password and the confirm password inputs and verify if they match.
If they do not match then it will send a Toast message to the user that passwords do not match.
If all the fields are not empty and the passwords match then it will send a toast welcome message to the user.
